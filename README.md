# Shopify Coding Challenge

## Problem Being Solved

You're a successful Shopify merchant! You've been busy promoting your store, and in the whirlwind of marketing, dealing with suppliers, and shipping ordersâ€”you've completely forgotten to count all your hard-earned money. Write a program that calculates your total order revenue

## How to execute

* Clone the repository (Make you sure you have the latest Rails 5.0.1 and bunlder installed)
* cd into the repository and execute bundle install
* Run rails server

* Go to http://localhost:3000/calculate_revenue/index for the table showing the final revenue as well as all the individual revenues from all the customers

* Used the total_line_items_price of the order set to calculate the total revenue
